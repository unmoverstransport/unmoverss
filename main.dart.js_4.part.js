UN Transport does not offer transportation services and is not responsible for any decisions made by drivers who are listed on the UN Transport website. You and the driver will enter into a contract for the supply of transportation services. Any arrangement made between you and a driver does not include UN Transport as a party. Any disagreements relating to the transportation services must be resolved directly between you and the driver.\n\nUN Transport disclaims all liability for any direct, indirect, or consequential loss of any kind, however caused, resulting from or related to the use of the UN Transport website or any content within. Any disagreement over this issue must be settled quickly and politely with the best interests of both parties in mind. If we are unable to come to an agreement, the parties will turn to a professional in the field to mediate. If mediation is unsuccessful, the dispute will be sent to an arbitrator chosen in accordance with the Arbitration Foundation of South Africa's rules. Despite the foregoing, both parties agree to the High Court of the Republic's jurisdiction of South Africa\n\nYou agree to abide by all South African laws when using the UN website and hiring transportation services, and you also agree not to use the UN Transport or the transportation services for any illegal activity.\n\nYou are not covered by insurance via UN Transport. It is solely your duty to make sure that any expensive, exotic, or other items that need to be transported are properly insured. In the event that your goods are lost or damaged, UN Transport will not be held liable. Any dispute involving the loss or damage of your items must be resolved between you and the driver. We ask that you email us at movers@untransport.co.za with the specifics of the loss or damage and how it occurred. We will do everything we can to help you with any claims you may have against the driver. This will enable us to take into account any punishment or discipline, including suspending the driver from the services.\n\nIf there is ever a disagreement between you and the driver, both sides will make an effort to settle it amicably. You and the driver may opt to use your own methods to resolve the dispute in accordance with the laws of the Republic of South Africa, since it is between two privately transacting parties.\n\nHowever, we reserve the right to reimburse you for a loss to your goods entirely at our discretion, according to our terms and conditions and any entitlements made available on our UN Transport website. This compensation shall be capped at an amount not to exceed the price of the linked UN Transport job.\n\nYou promise not to do anything that might harm UN Transport's reputation or bring it into shame.\n\nYou agree to defend UN Transport and its affiliates, directors, other users, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims or legal actions resulting from or related to any unauthorized use or misappropriation of the UN Transport.\n\nThe driver's agent, employee, employer, or associate is not UN Transport.\n\nIn order for UN Transport to deliver its service, you must submit accurate information, including banking information; otherwise, UN Transport reserves the right to immediately cancel this Agreement and your use of the UN Transport website, with or without prior notice.\n\nYou acknowledge that the UN Transport Privacy Policy, as it may be updated from time to time, will apply to your use of the UN Transport website.")
